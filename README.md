# dtw_cuda

ðŸš€ CUDA-accelerated Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) for PyTorch.

This library provides efficient computation of all-pairs DTW distances between sequences using rolling buffers and shared memory in CUDA.

---

## Features

- âœ… DTW on 1D or 2D float sequences
- âœ… Optimized memory usage with rolling buffer (O(L) space)
- âœ… All-pairs distance computation: input `[N, L] â†’ [N, N]`
- âœ… CUDA shared memory & parallelism
- âœ… Fallback CPU implementation for debugging

---

## Installation

```bash
pip install torch
python setup.py install
